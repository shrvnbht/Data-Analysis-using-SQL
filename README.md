This is a data exploration and cleaning project that utilized SQL to carry out the task. 
Some of the key features of this data-cleaning project are:
1. Standardising the date format.
2. Populating property addresses where the property address is NULL.
3. Separating the property address into street and city using SUBSTRING.
4. Separating the owner's address into street, city, and state using PARSENAME.
5. Updating columns; converting 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' for uniformity using Case.
6. Removing duplicate items in the table using a CTE.
7. Removing unused columns with the help of the Drop function.
